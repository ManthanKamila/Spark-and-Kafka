Streaming Data Analytics

Assume that you are working as analyst for “Pizzario”, a pizza delivery chain. The group has collected some interesting characteristics of customers who had purchased their pizza earlier. (Refer pizza_customers.csv). The marketing team is planning a campaign to increase the sales of a newly launched pizza. Before that they want to analyze the segmentation of existing customers so that they can have the clearer picture about the customer categories.

The project consists of
•	Python program that will take the pizza customers dataset as input and produce the clusters which represents the customer segments present in the dataset
•	Apply appropriate labels to those clusters after careful look at the points belonging to those clusters
•	A Python program that will simulate the movement of existing customers around a mall in near real time fashion
With the above 3 programs we create a streaming data pipeline integrating the various technologies, tools and Programmes that will harvest this real time data of customer’s movements and produces the offers that can be sent on the customers mobile devices. You can think of various aspects related to streaming data processing such as: 
•	Real time streaming data ingestion
•	Data’s intermittent storage
•	Data preprocessing – cleaning, transformations etc. 
•	Data processing – filters, joins, windows etc. 
•	Business logic for placing the offers
•	Final representation of the outcome

Technologies used- Kafka, Spark
